# Tuples and sets

# What is the major difference between tuples and lists?
# You cannot use append method on a tuple, tuples are immutable

# How do you create a tuple?
t = ()

# Sets
# What is unique about a set?
# set's cannot take duplicate items

# Use a set to find the unique values of the list below:
list5 = [1, 2, 2, 33, 4, 4, 11, 22, 3, 3, 2]
(set(list5))
